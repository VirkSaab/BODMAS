# BODMAS
BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders or pOwers, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. I used python 3.5 for this project. It will randomly generate an Elementary mathematics question based on BODMAS and ask the user to answer it. If user gives correct answer then corresponding points will be added to user's score which will be saved in a text file when you end a particular session. If user gives incorrect response then it tells the user that answer is wrong and shows correct answer to user for that question. It ask for user name at start so that it can store scores with user's names which also gives flexibility to store multiple users score.
